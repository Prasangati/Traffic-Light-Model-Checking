Expected Behavior:
The center lane (lane2) should eventually receive a green light infinitely often.
This ensures no traffic lane is permanently blocked.

What the Counterexample Shows:
Initially, lane3 is green.
A pedestrian presses button1, triggering the walk signal.
WDW lights turn on (northwdw = TRUE, southwdw = TRUE).
Pedestrian requests keep coming right before the WDW lights turn off, extending the walk phase indefinitely.
Because the walk phase never ends, lane transitions never resume.
Lane2 never turns green, contradicting the property.

Why This Happens:
There is no limit on how often pedestrians can press the button.
Walk signals override lane transitions, creating a starvation condition.
